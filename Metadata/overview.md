This extension provides Azure Pipelines tasks to package, publish, and manage Azure DevOps extensions in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com).

## How to use

After installing this extension in your Azure DevOps organization, add one or more tasks to your [Azure Pipelines YAML pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops).

You can find an end-to-end example in this repository’s [azure-pipelines.yml](https://github.com/jessehouwing/azdo-marketplace/blob/main/azure-pipelines.yml).

For authenticated operations, you can use either a Personal Access Token (PAT) or Microsoft Entra ID Workload Identity Federation (OIDC).

- PAT setup: [Use personal access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops)
- OIDC setup guide: [Authentication and OIDC](https://github.com/jessehouwing/azdo-marketplace/blob/main/docs/authentication-and-oidc.md)

## Microsoft Entra ID Workload Federation (OIDC)

This extension supports Azure Pipelines service connections based on **Azure Resource Manager + Workload Identity Federation**.

- No long-lived PAT secret is required in your pipeline.
- Azure Pipelines requests short-lived tokens during the run.
- Use `connectionType: connectedService:AzureRM` for non-package operations.

For setup details, required marketplace resource scope, and troubleshooting, see:
