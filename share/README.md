```

### Share Using VSIX Identity Fallback

    accounts: 'myorg'
```

## Inputs

### Required Inputs

Identity (choose one):

OR

- `auth-type: oidc`: Use OIDC authentication (requires `azure/login` action first)

### Optional Inputs

#### Authentication

- `auth-type`: Authentication type (`pat` or `oidc`, default: `pat`)
- `token`: Personal Access Token (required when auth-type is `pat`)

#### TFX Configuration

- `tfx-version`: Version of tfx-cli to use (default: `built-in`)

#### Identity Fallback

- `vsix-path`: Path to VSIX file used to infer `publisher-id` and `extension-id` when omitted

## Example: Share on Release

```yaml
name: Share Extension

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  share:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: jessehouwing/azdo-marketplace/share@v6
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.MARKETPLACE_TOKEN }}
          publisher-id: 'my-publisher'
          extension-id: 'my-extension'
          accounts: |
            customer-org-1
            customer-org-2
```

## GitHub Marketplace sample

```yaml
- uses: jessehouwing/azdo-marketplace/share@v6
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.MARKETPLACE_TOKEN }}
    publisher-id: my-publisher
    extension-id: my-extension
    accounts: customer-org
```

## GitHub Marketplace inputs

- `auth-type`: Selects authentication mode (`pat`, `basic`, or `oidc`).
- `token`: Provides PAT/secret token for authenticated share operations.
- `username`: Provides username when `auth-type` is `basic`.
- `service-url`: Overrides the Azure DevOps/Marketplace endpoint.
- `tfx-version`: Selects which `tfx-cli` version/source is used; `built-in` uses the bundled JS entrypoint without `.bin` shim fallback, `path` uses `tfx` from PATH.
- `publisher-id`: Identifies the publisher that owns the extension to share.
- `extension-id`: Identifies the extension to share.
- `vsix-path`: Provides VSIX-based identity fallback when publisher/extension IDs are omitted.
- `accounts`: Lists organizations/accounts that receive extension access.

## GitHub Marketplace outputs

- No outputs: success/failure indicates whether sharing completed.
